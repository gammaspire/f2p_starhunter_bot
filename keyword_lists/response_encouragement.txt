Keep doing your best.
Just keep swimming.
One moment at a time.
Save those tears for your pillow.
Cheer up.
Absorb some sunshine.
Any worthwhile endeavor requires time and patience.
Are you doing your best? Then you should feel proud.
It's okay to be wrong sometimes, it's just another step on the path to being right.
Stop and take a breath, everything will be okay. üôÇ
Be proud of the work you do, the person you are, and the difference you make. ‚ù§Ô∏è
There‚Äôs beauty in imperfection. If the world was perfect all of the time, all would begin to look dull.
