Keep doing your best
Just keep swimming
One moment at a time
Save those tears for your pillow
Cheer up
Absorb some sunshine
Any worthwhile endeavor will take time and patience
Smile
If you are doing your best then worry not
It's okay to be wrong sometimes, it's just another step on the path to being right.
Stop and take a breath, everything will be okay. ðŸ™‚
