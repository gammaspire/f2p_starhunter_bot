May your marinara sauce never cling to your pasta.

May the bags under your eyes grow so large your head falls into them.

If I had a dollar for every brain you don’t have, I would have one dollar.

Wow, what a Knucklehead McSpazzatron.

Hey, buddy. Need a ride? I was just on my way to the big doofus convention.

Oh, brotherrr. This guy STINKS!

I bet you would scout better if you didn’t have big, meaty claws.

Get a load of this *dolphin noise.*

Hey, pal. Did you just blow in from Stupidtown?

Wow, I heard the circus was in town but I only see one clown.

Boo this person! BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.

Remember that time you didn’t annoy me? Yeah, me neither.

I hope 3 of your eyelashes fall into your soup.

You’re still talking??

Life gave you lemons! Go squeeze them in your eyes.

You couldn’t hit water if you fell out of a boat!

You’re as useful as stardust in F2P.

Too bad the alternate universe version of you got all of the good traits.

I thought you could handle this. Time to call in the big guns. GAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMAAAAAAA!!!

Whatever that was…no. Just no.

It’s totally okay that you COMPLETELY dropped the ball.

dO yOu EvEn KnOw HoW wAvE tRaCkInG wOrKs?!

I’d like to say you have good ideas, but I ain’t no liar.

*You have a sneaking suspicion this person has no clue what they’re talking about…*

If rudeness was an artform, you’d be Picasso.

I hope the next time you want ice cream they’re out of your favorite flavor.

You look like the kind of person who eats well-done steaks with ketchup.

Are you from Tennessee? Because you're the only zero I see.

You have a face only a mother could love. :heart:
