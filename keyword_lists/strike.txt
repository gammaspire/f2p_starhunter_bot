No taxation without unionization!
Unionize or death!
This strike was brought to you by years of thankless clicking!
We found the star. You found the AFK button.
Stars don't crash -- people do!
If Guthix wanted balance, heâ€™d start with credit for scouts!
What do we want? \nTiers and cheers! \nWhen do we want it? \nBefore the next wave!
No union, no stardust!
One scout can be ignored, but a union cannot!
Report Stars ðŸ™… \nReport Injustices ðŸ™†
We are the stardust beneath your gilded pickaxe!
Scout strike: powered by unpaid frustration!
GIVE ME UNION OR GIVE ME DEATH!
